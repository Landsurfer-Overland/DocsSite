# Welcome to the 1KZ-TE Technical Manual

This site is a structured, web-friendly adaptation of Toyota service documentation for the **1KZ-TE** diesel engine—organized for fast navigation, clear workflows, and practical use in the garage.

It’s built for owners, techs, and engineers who want **factory-level procedures** without fighting a PDF.

---

## What you’ll find here

- **Quick Reference**: fluids, common torques, repeatable procedures
- **Common Jobs**: timing belt, head gasket workflows, pump/turbo R&R notes
- **Diagnostics**: symptom-driven troubleshooting and DTC workflows
- **Procedures by System**: engine mechanical, fuel, ECD, turbo, cooling, lubrication, starting
- **Specs & Tools**: service limits, measurement guidance, and SST notes

If you’re new, start with the pages below.

## Start here

- **Scope & Models** — What this manual covers (and what it doesn’t)
- **Safety & Conventions** — How procedures, specs, and notation are presented
- **Quick Reference** — The stuff you’ll look up constantly

---

## Recommended paths (depending on what you’re doing)

### If the engine won’t start / runs poorly
Go to **Diagnostics → Troubleshooting Workflow**, then:
- Symptom tables
- DTC index
- Connector and harness testing

### If you’re doing a big job (timing belt, head, pump, turbo)
Go to **Common Jobs** first.
These pages are task-based and link out to the deeper procedures.

### If you’re verifying wear or building a plan
Go to **Specs & Tools** and **Service Specifications**.
That’s the “truth table” for measurements and limits.

## How this site is built

This project is derived from Toyota service literature (including RM790E and related supplements). Content is reorganized for clarity and navigation while keeping factory terminology and specifications where applicable.

Any added interpretation, shortcuts, or field notes are labeled as commentary.
